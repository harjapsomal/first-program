        <body>Most people take their health for granted until
            something happens to them. 
            Even then, they just go to the doctor and get a "pill" to solve the issue.
            What they never realise is that the body is degined to heal itself, and that
            the only reason we get a "disease" is because we are not giving the body what it
            needs to stay healthy, such as the correct food, exercise and sleep.
            Once we change this - the body heals itself.

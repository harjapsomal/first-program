        <body>Why is this happening?
            Our lifestyle is changing and effecting our bodies.
            Cars were a luxury in 1950, and now most families have several cars in the family.
            We used to walk and now we drive. 
            At work we have lifts which most of us use instead of stairs.
            The Food we eat is no longer nutritious. We order from home delivery services
            It is fast food made with unhealthy ingredients.
            We are stressed out in our work environments.
            We get little natural exercise. 
            Even TVs have remotes so we don't have to move from the couch.
            All of this has a great toll on our health.
            The combination of all of these factors is devastating on the body.
            Just think about it:
            Very little exercise.
            non-nutritious mass-produced and unhealthy food is our daily diet.
            Sugar intake has reached epidemic levels.
            As a consequence, type 2 diabetes has become a common disease.
